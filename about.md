I'm a Junior student at BUPT, majoring in Intelligent Interaction Design. I have a strong interest in designing intuitive and engaging human-computer interfaces, with a focus on interactive web applications and intelligent tools that enhance human experience. I enjoy exploring how thoughtful interaction design can make technology more accessible, efficient and enjoyable.
